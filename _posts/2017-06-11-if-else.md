### Introduction

When writing a program, you rarely want the exact same outcome every time. Often you will receive some data, inspect the data and decide how to proceed based on that data. For example, in a web application you may like to apply different classes to odd and even table-rows to create visual distinctions. In a game you would want to take different actions if a player hits an obstacle than if they didn't. We can fork programs into different operational paths using `if` statements.

The use of `if` statements relies on boolean data types, switching paths depending on whether a condition is `true` or `false`.

### The syntax

In javascript an `if` statement looks something like this:

    {% highlight javascript %}
    firstStatements;

    if (condition) {
        conditionalStatements;
    }

    lastStatements;
    {% endhighlight %}

In this example, should the `condition` resolve to `true` the program would execute `firstStatements`, `conditionalStatements`, then `lastStatements`. However should condition resolve to `false` the program would only execute `firstStatements` and `lastStatements`, skipping over the conditional statements without executing them.

Occasionally, you may like to take an alternative action, should the condition be false. In which case your code will look like this:

    {% highlight javascript %}
    firstStatements;

    if (condition) {
        conditionalStatements;
    } else {
        alternativeStatements;
    }

    lastStatements;
    {% endhighlight %}

In this example, should the `condition` evaluate to true the program would still execute `firstStatements`, `conditionalStatements`, then `lastStatements` as before. However, this time when the statement is false it will execute `firstStatements`, `alternativeStatements`, then `lastStatements`. As before, the first & last statements are always executed, as they are outside of the flow.

Sometimes, you may also need to chain multiple conditionals. For this we have `else if` used like this:

    {% highlight javascript %}
    firstStatements;

    if (condition) {
        conditionalStatements;
    } else if (secondCondition) {
        differentStatements;
    } else {
        alternativeStatements;
    }

    lastStatements;
    {% endhighlight %}

In this example, the `differentStatements` will only be run if the first condition fails, and the second condition passes. The `alternativeStatements` will only run if _both_ conditions fail.

### some real-world examples

##### Example 1

    {% highlight javascript %}
    var str = document.getElementById('nameField').value;
    if (str.length > 20) {
        str = str.substr(0, 18) + '...';
    }
    {% endhighlight %}

In example 1, we fetch a string value from an input field. We then compare the length of the string to a desired maximum display length (20) and if it exceeds that length, we cut it down to it's first 18 characters, and append an ellipsis.

##### Example 2

    {% highlight javascript %}
    function addDelivery(basket) {
        if (basket.getTotal() < 100) {
            basket.addItem('delivery', 10.00);
        }
    }
    {% endhighlight %}

In this example, we add a delivery charge of £10.00 to someones shopping bill, only if the basket contains items totalling less than £100.

##### Example 3

    {% highlight javascript %}
    function fixHeader(el, elOffsetTop, scrollY) {
        if (scrollY >= elOffsetTop && !el.classList.contains('fixed')) {
            el.classList.add('fixed');
        } else if (scrollY < elOffsetTop && el.classList.contains('fixed')) {
            el.classList.remove('fixed');
        }
    }
    {% endhighlight %}

In this example, a DOM element (`el`) has a class of `fixed` added or removed depending on the scroll position of the document.


##### Example 5

    {% highlight javascript %}
    function fizzBuzzNumber(n) {
        var str = '';
        if (n % 3 === 0) {
            str += 'Fizz';
        }
        if (n % 5 === 0) {
            str += 'Buzz';
        }

        if (str.length > 0) {
            return str;
        } else {
            return '' + n;
        }
    }
    {% endhighlight %}

In this function, the popular coding challenge `FizzBuzz` is solved using if / else statements. An integer `Number` is supplied and checked to see if it divides by 3 or 5. If it does `Fizz` or `Buzz` are returned. If divisible by both `FizzBuzz` is returned. If divisible by neither, the Number is converted to a string and returned.
